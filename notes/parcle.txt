npx parcel index.html

Parcle can do:

Dev build
Local server
HMR- Hot module Replacement
File watching algorithm -- written in c++
caching -Faster build , it will save in .parcle-cache
Image Optimization
Minification
Bundling
Compress
Consistant hashing
Code splitting
Differential Bundling -- support older version browser
Tree shaking algoritham - will remove unused code
Defferent Dev and producation bundles

For Production build - npx parcle build index.html -> you need to remove "main "app.js"" file in package.json file



If you want excecute a package we need to use npx

getting react cdn links are not good practice

npm install React

npm install react-dom 

import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";

script type="module" src="app.js"> you need to mention type="module" for working import react

npx parcel build index.html -- It will generate production build code

npx meaning excecute the project

cdn is not good way to implement react project.

If we use npm ,package.json it will easy to generate any version of code in the future and not required to hit network calls

npm install react

npm install react-dom 

npm i react-dom is short form


if we use -D it will be a devDependencies
"devDependencies": {
    "parcel": "^2.12.0",
    "process": "^0.11.10"
  },
 
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "^18.3.1",
    "react-dom": "^18.3.1"
  }

  browser script can't have imports or exports use this <script type="module" src="./app.js"> instead of <script src="./app.js">

   <script src="./app.js"> it will consider normal java script , so we can use ****** type="module" ****
