React components

two types

Class based 
Functional
----

component name should start with Capital letter

 const Title =()=>(
        <h1 className="Head">Namasthe react using jsx</h1>
    )
function returns the react element that is called funcational component
React element is a JSX 

Functional component IS Function IT WILL return jsx

 we need to render component like root.render(<HeadingComponet/>) we should place in < >
  root.render(<HeadingComponet/>)

 for element root.render(Heading) not requires <>

 component composition is placing one component in another component

  const HeadingComponet = ()=> (
        <div id ="containrer">
         <Title/>
         {Title()}
         <Title></Title>
         {jsxHeading}
         <h1> This is funcational component</h1>
        </div>
    )

 Any JavaScript expression can write in component using {}

 we can call Functional component in below ways

   <Title/>
    {Title()}
     <Title></Title>

{data} whenever we put component in {} ,jsx cann't put data directly it can sanitize the data
