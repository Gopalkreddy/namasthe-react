npm is not stands for node package manager

it doesn't have any full form

it manages packages

it is a standard package it has all the libraries, it manages that for us

For the npm installation need to run

---npm init----- while running it asks some inputs after providing the inputs package.json file will create
package.json is the configuration for npm, it keeps what version is using

npm will take care of verion of libraries using package.json

Bundler: webpack,parcel,veet

npm install -D parcle 
_d
There are two types of dependences 
 1) dev ->It requires development
 2) Normal

  "react": "^18.3.1" --> it will update next minor verion automaticaly

   "react": "~18.3.1" --> it will update major version automaticaly

package.lock.json : it keeps exact version

Transative dependency -- one dependence depends on other dependence

If you have package.json and package-lock.json we can recreate all node modules

node modules is collection of dependences
